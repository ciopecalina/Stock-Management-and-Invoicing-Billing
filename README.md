Informatic System for Stock Management and Invoicing & Billing

  Created a fully functional Informatic System for Stock Management and Invoicing &
Billing, very similar to the existing ones on the market. Decided to combine my interest in
Financial Accounting with the knowledge in Economic Informatics.
  - facilitates successfully the communication between the companies (supplier and
client), if both sides use this same application, allows generating and sending/
receiving important financial documents, exporting and viewing in Excel/Word/PDF
formats, generating useful reports, charts, etc.
  - allows data control and manipulation in real time by using a cloud database
  
  Developed in Visual Studio in C# using .NET Framework, Visual Studio Tools for Office,
Azure SQL Database in Microsoft Cloud, T-SQL
